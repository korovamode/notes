# Ads in AI Assistants: A Short FAQ

Korovamode | February 7, 2026


“**Ads in AI**” (including **ChatGPT ads**) is about a simple shift: AI assistants and chatbots can become advertising surfaces. The important detail is *where* the ads live—next to the answer, or inside the answer—and how that changes what it means to “get help” from an assistant.


### 1) So… are ads coming to AI chatbots?
Yes. **AI chatbot advertising** is now being discussed as a real product direction. The key shift is that the chat interface can become an ad surface—especially the **answer** itself.

### 2) Does this mean ChatGPT will have ads?
It can. When people say **ChatGPT ads**, they usually mean either ads shown alongside the answer (a sponsored block) or ads that influence what gets recommended. Those are different experiences.

### 3) Where would the ads show up—on the screen, or inside the answer?
Two main models:
- **Ads below answers**: a labeled sponsored unit appears under the response.  
- **Ads inside answers**: the promotion is blended into the response itself.  

Most debate about **ads in AI answers** is really debate about which model becomes normal.

### 4) Will the AI recommend products because it’s paid to?
That’s the concern behind **sponsored answers**. Even if ads are “separate,” paid incentives can still shape what gets recommended, what gets emphasized, or what becomes the default option.

### 5) How can someone tell a real recommendation from a sponsored one?
If it’s clearly labeled “Sponsored,” it’s easy. The harder case is when promotion looks like ordinary guidance: a “helpful” default product, a subtle brand mention, or a recommendation blended into the response.

### 6) If it has ads, can the answers still be trusted?
Trust becomes more complicated because an ad model adds a second objective—monetization. Influence can show up as **cognitive steering**: changes in framing, defaults, tone, and what gets omitted, not only explicit falsehoods.

### 7) Will the ads be personalized based on what someone types into the chat?
That’s a central worry with **in-chat ads** and **conversational ads**. A chat system can infer intent from the question itself (“shopping,” “stress,” “health,” “money”), which can make targeting more precise than traditional ad placement.

### 8) Can companies pay to get mentioned when someone asks for advice?
Direct payment is one path (classic advertising). Another path is optimizing for inclusion without explicit ads—pushing for **brand mentions in AI answers** and higher **AI visibility**. Either way, the goal is the same: **being in the answer**.

### 9) Is this basically the new SEO—brands trying to show up in AI answers?
Yes. That’s why terms like these are spreading:
- **AEO (Answer Engine Optimization)**: optimizing content so assistants use it as the answer (and sometimes cite it).  
- **GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)**: optimizing visibility inside generative outputs across systems.  

In “answer engines,” the competition shifts from ranking links to representation in the response.
