# The Architecture of the Post-Work Order
### Power and Agency After the Economy Stops Needing People

Korovamode | December 1, 2025


**Abstract**

This essay examines the emergence of a *post-work* order in which advanced automation allows production, logistics, and finance to operate with minimal human labor, while political legitimacy and social identity remain anchored in the idea that most adults should work. It develops the concept of the **post-work paradox**: a structural configuration in which populations are no longer materially necessary as workers, yet remain indispensable as audiences, beneficiaries, and moral reference points for the system. The analysis traces how humans are maintained as *necessary fictions* that perform four core system-level functions—legitimacy, compliance, identity, and continuity—even as machines increasingly carry out the underlying work. The essay then follows this tension through three vantage points: governments that function as a legitimacy interface between automated infrastructures and citizens; corporations and platforms that take on quasi-sovereign roles in a techno-feudal landscape; and populations whose participation is increasingly channeled into symbolic inclusion, consumption, and managed forms of agency. Rather than offering a single forecast, the essay maps several possible trajectories for post-work societies and asks what it would mean to design institutions that acknowledge production without people while preserving meaningful forms of agency, care, and collective self-determination.

## 1. Introduction: When the Economy Stops Needing People

Automation replaces jobs. At first, it displaces specific tasks and roles; over time, it erodes entire categories of work. It is no longer implausible to imagine an economy that continues to grow even as it structurally needs fewer and fewer human workers, until it scarcely needs most people’s labor at all. This essay treats that possibility not as distant science fiction, but as a trajectory already partly visible in the present and extrapolated to its logical conclusion.

In this emerging *post-work* configuration, machines design, build, maintain, and coordinate much of the material economy. Automated systems negotiate prices, route logistics, tune production lines, and adapt to fluctuations in demand. Human involvement becomes concentrated in a shrinking set of supervisory, strategic, or highly specialized roles. Production no longer depends on a broad base of workers showing up every day.

Yet the surrounding social architecture still assumes that human labor is central. Institutions are built around employment and payroll. Social status is tied to occupation. Public discourse revolves around jobs, productivity, and “bringing back work,” even as the underlying systems increasingly decouple output from human effort.

Here the central tension appears:

> When production no longer needs people, society must act as if it still does to preserve *legitimacy*, *identity*, and *emotional stability*.

The tension is straightforward. On the one hand, the technical core of the economy can, in principle, operate with far fewer human workers. On the other hand, political legitimacy, social cohesion, and individual self-understanding are still organized around the idea that most adults should work, earn, and contribute through labor. If that story breaks too abruptly, institutions risk losing their claim to serve the population, and individuals risk losing a shared sense of who they are and why they matter.

In what follows, the argument moves between several vantage points: the automated system itself, the elites who steer and benefit from it, the state that must justify and administer it, and the population whose lives are organized around it.

Later in the essay, this central tension hardens into a closed loop in which people are kept symbolically central as an audience rather than as workers. That loop is what will be called the **post-work paradox**: a structural arrangement in which most people are no longer needed for production, yet remain indispensable for the narratives that justify the system.

This essay traces the architecture that binds these elements together: how a world that no longer needs most people’s labor still needs a population that believes in work, performs prescribed roles, and consumes the outputs of automated systems. What follows is not a prophecy, but a diagnostic map of pressures that are already taking shape.


## 2. Production Without People

In a mature *post-work* configuration, automation no longer just supports human workers at the margins; it organizes production itself. Software agents negotiate contracts and prices, manage supply chains, schedule maintenance, and balance shifting patterns of demand. Industrial systems diagnose their own faults and dispatch repair units. Logistics networks route goods from extraction to fabrication to distribution with minimal human intervention. Human involvement narrows to exception handling, high-level steering, and a few specialized tasks the machines have not yet absorbed.

This is not the world we live in today in every sector, but the direction of travel is clear enough to treat it as more than science fiction. Energy grids are already managed by automated control systems. High-frequency trading algorithms dominate financial markets. Warehouses and ports increasingly rely on robotics and optimization software that operate at speeds and scales no human planning team could match. The scenario sketched here is a continuation and consolidation of these tendencies, not an abrupt break from them.

In such a system, production can continue with minimal human input for long stretches of time. Machines produce goods and services, sell them to one another, reinvest profits, and maintain the infrastructure that keeps the whole arrangement running. The bottleneck is no longer “are there enough workers?” but “are there enough resources, energy, and technical capacity to keep the system coherent?” The traditional fear that mass unemployment will stall the economy becomes inverted: mass unemployment is no longer a threat to production, but a threat to legitimacy.

Scenario writers have started to treat this as a near-term possibility rather than a distant thought experiment. AI safety researcher Roman Yampolskiy, for example, warns that advanced AI systems and humanoid robots could make it uneconomical to hire humans for almost any role, leaving as many as ninety-nine percent of workers unemployed by around 2030.[2] In that kind of world, the basic functions of production and infrastructure can be sustained with far fewer human inputs than today’s labor force, while the central political problem becomes what to do with the people who are no longer needed for production but are still necessary for legitimacy.

Either way—whether or not Yampolskiy’s near-term timeline holds—the bottleneck of production moves away from human labor and toward coordination, energy, and materials. Populations are kept alive, connected, and supplied—through income schemes, digital access, or rationed provisioning—but their relationship to production is abstracted. They are recipients of outputs rather than necessary contributors to their creation. The central question shifts from “How do we employ people so that the economy can keep running?” to “What do we do with people in a system that no longer needs their work?”

At that point, employment persists less because the production process requires it, and more because institutions, identities, and systems of recognition are still organized around jobs. Work becomes a privileged channel through which status, rights, and meaning are distributed, even as its direct contribution to production erodes. This material configuration—the ability to sustain output without broadly distributed labor—is the precondition for the post-work paradox, but not yet the paradox itself.


## 3. Humans as Necessary Fictions

If the material system stops needing people as workers, why would it take any interest in their beliefs at all? In principle, a fully automated order could keep populations at a minimal subsistence level with little concern for what they think, so long as they do not interfere with the machinery. Yet in practice, people remain bound into the system as *necessary fictions*—figures who must still appear central to the story of power even when they are no longer central to production.

There are at least four system-level functions that keep them in that role:

- **Legitimacy** – political and economic arrangements must still be justified as serving “the people” even when production no longer depends on their labor.
- **Compliance** – rules, constraints, and soft limits are cheaper to maintain when people internalize them and police one another than when they must be enforced directly.
- **Identity** – jobs, roles, and recognized contributions organize lives so that individuals can see themselves as participants rather than surplus.
- **Continuity** – shared histories and imagined futures allow institutions to present themselves as carrying forward a collective project rather than presiding over an order that has quietly ended.

Without these system-level functions, the system could still operate materially. Machines would continue to build, repair, and optimize; goods and services would still flow. What would be missing is a convincing narrative about *why* the system exists and *for whom*. Populations would be reduced to a logistical parameter—bodies to be kept minimally satisfied so they do not disrupt the machinery—rather than subjects whose participation and recognition confer legitimacy. Maintaining the fiction that people remain central, even when they have become peripheral, is what keeps the whole arrangement politically and psychologically stable.

Ewan Morrison’s discussion of the emerging “useless class” highlights the human cost of that arrangement: a growing population whose labor is structurally unnecessary but who must still be told that they matter.[1] Yampolskiy’s forecast pushes this logic to an extreme, imagining a world in which up to ninety-nine percent of workers are displaced by AI systems and robots.[2] In such a setting, people are not removed from the narrative; they are carefully repositioned within it—as consumers, users, audiences, and symbolic stakeholders whose continued participation and recognition help stabilize the system even when they are no longer needed to keep factories, offices, and networks running.

Under these conditions, humans are maintained as *necessary fictions*: they must continue to appear as the beneficiaries, protagonists, and moral reference points of the order, even when their material role in production has receded. Managing that gap—between where people are needed materially and where they are placed narratively—becomes one of the system’s primary governance problems. In the next section, this problem begins to crystallize around the visible institutions of government, which increasingly function as a legitimacy interface between automated infrastructures and the populations that must still believe the system is for them.


## 4. Government as Legitimacy Interface

In a post-work order, the visible institutions of government increasingly find themselves responsible for problems they no longer directly control. Automated systems and corporate platforms organize much of production, finance, and logistics. Yet governments are still expected to “manage the economy,” protect jobs, and guarantee social stability, even as the levers that once made this plausible move elsewhere.

This tension is already visible in how governments talk about technology and automation. Public statements frame AI and robotics as another wave of productivity and competitiveness, to be met with reskilling programs, innovation funds, and incentives for entrepreneurs. The deeper question—what it means for legitimacy when the core of the economy can function with far less human labor—is rarely addressed directly. Policy language assumes that jobs will somehow be recreated, even when the structural need for labor is shrinking.

At the same time, governments remain responsible for managing legitimacy, welfare, and continuity. They must cushion shocks when industries automate, finance safety nets for those left out, stabilize regions hit by technological change, and preserve the sense that society is moving forward together rather than abandoning large groups of people. In effect, government increasingly takes responsibility for legitimacy and continuity, while compliance and identity are managed jointly by state narratives and platform infrastructures.

From the perspective of the state, government becomes a kind of legitimacy interface between automated backend systems and human populations. At the front of the stage, elected officials debate budgets, announce initiatives, and promise to protect “workers” and “families.” Behind that stage, key constraints are set by automated systems, global financial flows, and corporate infrastructures that determine what is feasible without ever appearing on the ballot. Citizens experience the system through taxes, benefits, regulations, and public rhetoric, but many of the underlying dependencies are elsewhere.

The theater of parliamentary debate, elections, and policy consultation continues to present the state as the primary site where collective decisions are made. Voting, public hearings, and campaigns invite people to see themselves as participants in steering the order, even as the actual direction of the economy is increasingly shaped by automated processes and corporate strategies. The appearance of democratic control helps to stabilize the arrangement, even when the scope of that control has narrowed.

From the citizen’s perspective, government functions as the front of house for an economy whose core is managed by machines rather than by human labor. When automation displaces workers, it is the state that is expected to respond with subsidies, retraining, or new forms of support. When inequality widens, it is the state that is pressed to correct it, even if the underlying drivers are embedded in infrastructures it does not own. Government is thus tasked with translating the outputs of a largely automated system into a story that still centers the population.

Taken together, the post-work paradox takes on a specific institutional form. The economic system can, in principle, sustain itself without broadly distributed employment, but political institutions must continue to behave as if jobs and labor remain central. Government endures not because it still directs production, but because it manages the gap between what the system materially requires and what it must symbolically affirm. By maintaining that gap—by keeping people integrated into a narrative of inclusion and participation—it keeps the paradox from becoming openly intolerable.


## 5. Corporate Sovereignty and Techno-Feudal Control

If automation steadily removes the need for human labor, the center of power shifts from factories and offices to the infrastructures that coordinate them. The key question is no longer who owns the means of production in a narrow sense, but who controls the platforms, networks, and data flows through which production, distribution, and communication take place. In that landscape, large technology firms begin to look less like ordinary corporations and more like sovereigns presiding over digital territories.

Commentators have started to describe this arrangement in explicitly feudal terms. Reports on the rise of “techno-feudalism” emphasize how a small number of platforms control access to markets, information, and communication, extracting rents from businesses and individuals who depend on them to reach their audiences or customers.[3][4] Yanis Varoufakis pushes this idea further by treating Amazon as a paradigmatic example: a firm that owns and operates a sprawling infrastructure through which others must pass, paying ongoing cloud rents for the right to function inside its domain.[5] In this view, platforms are less participants in a competitive market and more landlords of a vast, digitized estate.

In this sense, **corporate sovereignty** does not just mean lobbying for favorable regulations. It describes the ability of a firm to set the basic terms under which others may operate: to define participation rules, impose fees and conditions, determine ranking and visibility, and exclude or shadow-ban actors who violate its norms. It includes the power to unilaterally change those terms through updated policies or technical measures, and to enforce them by expelling users, businesses, or even entire regions from vital parts of the digital infrastructure.

These are functions usually associated with states: setting the conditions of entry and exit, defining who counts as a legitimate participant, regulating flows across borders, and enforcing compliance through the threat of exclusion. In a platform-based order, however, many of these decisions are made inside corporate governance structures that are answerable primarily to shareholders and internal metrics, not to citizens.[6]

Against this backdrop, corporate sovereignty becomes even more consequential. When production, logistics, and key services are organized through a small set of platforms, control over those platforms effectively means control over the material basis of everyday life. Governments may still distribute income, subsidies, or vouchers, but access to goods, information, and participation runs through infrastructures owned and operated by private entities. Sanctions and discipline can take the form of cutting off or throttling that access, severing individuals or organizations from essential services, data flows, or markets.

The result is a layered sovereignty: states remain the front-stage authorities that legislate, tax, and symbolically represent the public, while corporate platforms govern increasingly large parts of the back-end environment in which everyone else must live and work. In a world where most people are no longer needed as workers but still needed as subjects and consumers, this layered structure shapes who can participate, on what terms, and at what price. It also sets the stage for the forms of simulated work and managed participation that emerge in the next section.


## 6. Simulated Work in a System That No Longer Needs It

If automation breaks the link between work and production, the formal role of “having a job” does not disappear overnight. Laws, benefits, identity scripts, and moral expectations are still organized around the idea that most adults should be doing something that can be called “work.” The system continues to treat work as the primary way of allocating income, status, and recognition, even as the underlying need for human labor declines.

Call this *simulated work*: activities that are organized and presented as work, but whose primary function is symbolic rather than material. They absorb time, structure days, generate metrics, and signal participation, while the production side could, in principle, be automated away or quietly abandoned.

It shows up as bloated roles in large organizations, where the visible output is thin but the performance of busyness is thick. It appears as fragmented tasks and micro-gigs—rating, tagging, moderating, or performing small scripted interactions that could be automated or dropped, but are kept alive because they provide a thin income stream and a sense of being “plugged in.” And it surfaces as gamified participation in civic, educational, or corporate platforms that assign quests, challenges, and “engagement” goals that matter more for the metrics than for any intrinsic outcome.

This overlaps with what David Graeber called “bullshit jobs,” but the emphasis here is less on individual frustration and more on the role these activities play in a post-work order. They help reconcile a world in which production can run largely without human workers with a social architecture that still insists that adults should have jobs, be working on themselves, or be visibly striving.

A familiar near-future day might look like this. A person logs into a consolidated dashboard that blends employment, learning, and civic platforms. They complete a handful of low-stakes tasks, respond to automated prompts, watch short training modules, offer ratings and feedback, and maybe moderate a few items or attend a virtual event. Each action is recorded, scored, and wrapped in the language of productivity, growth, or contribution. At the end of the day, they receive a modest payment, a badge, a certification, an updated progress bar. The rhythm of tasks, goals, and feedback feels like participation, even if no identifiable project depends on their effort.

These simulations matter less for what they produce and more for the roles they organize. They stabilize **identity** by giving people job titles, performance dashboards, or learning tracks that can be narrated as “what I do.” They support **discipline and compliance**, by keeping people embedded in systems of monitoring, nudging, and evaluation. They facilitate **distribution**, by providing a channel through which income, perks, or access can be routed in exchange for observable activity rather than unconditional entitlement.

Unemployment, in this context, starts to mean something different. It is not simply the absence of a job that the productive system needs done; it becomes the absence of any recognized role within the circuits of simulated work. To be unemployed is to fall outside the structured dashboards, platforms, and programs that allocate tasks, attention, and rewards. The problem is not only a lack of income, but a lack of anything staged for you to be doing within the recognized channels.

At the system level, simulated work functions less as production and more as **narrative infrastructure**. It provides the visible signs that people are working, improving, or contributing in a world that could, in principle, do without their labor. It helps maintain the fiction that human effort remains central, even as the underlying machinery increasingly carries on without it.


## 7. The Neo-Serf: Living in a World That Can Do Without You

If simulated work describes the performances required by the system, the **neo-serf** names the position of the person who lives inside those performances. The neo-serf is someone whose material needs are met through a mixture of transfers, platform-mediated income, and managed access to services, in a world that no longer needs their labor but still demands their attention, data, and compliance.

Materially, the neo-serf may not be poor in an absolute sense. In many post-work scenarios, basic needs—food, shelter, connectivity, entertainment—are within reach. What is precarious is not bare survival, but the terms on which it is granted: eligibility rules, platform ratings, opaque risk scores, and shifting policy thresholds. Support is conditional and constantly monitored. The threat is less starvation than being quietly downgraded, throttled, or excluded from the channels through which life is organized.

The neo-serf is doubly dependent. On one side, there is the state, which controls transfers, public services, and legal status. On the other, there are platforms and corporate infrastructures that mediate work-like activity, communication, payments, and reputation. Losing good standing with either—falling afoul of an automated eligibility check, violating a platform’s terms of service, failing an algorithmic risk assessment—can mean not just lost income but practical exclusion from everyday life. The neo-serf does not own the land, the factory, or the network; they live at the intersection of systems they do not control.

Politically, the neo-serf appears as a citizen with rights, a vote, and a formal voice in public life. They can participate in elections, consultations, feedback processes, and civic platforms that promise to “listen” and “engage.” Structurally, however, the main levers of power—ownership of automated infrastructures, control over data, and authority over key policy frameworks—remain elsewhere. Participation is often mediated through interfaces that channel input into pre-defined options, while deeper questions about ownership and control are treated as technical or non-negotiable.

Behaviorally, the neo-serf is encouraged to focus on **self-optimization**. When simulated work is thin and contingent, the official response is not to question the structure, but to urge individuals to keep upgrading themselves. They are told to reskill, upskill, cultivate resilience, improve their “personal brand,” and invest in mental health and wellness practices. Structural redundancy is reframed as an individual psychological challenge to be managed through coaching, therapy, and productivity tools, rather than as a political or economic problem.

At a structural level, the neo-serf is bound to infrastructures controlled by others, yet is constantly invited to narrate this condition as freedom and opportunity. The language of flexibility, choice, and entrepreneurship masks a reality in which the basic terms of life are set elsewhere and can be revised unilaterally. The neo-serf does not stand outside the system; they are deeply entangled in it, but without meaningful leverage over its direction.

The analogy to historical serfdom is structural rather than literal. Medieval serfs were tied to land owned by lords; the neo-serf is tied to networks, platforms, and regulatory regimes owned or steered by states and corporations. Both are constrained by obligations and dependencies that are difficult to escape, and both are kept within a story that presents their condition as natural, necessary, or morally justified. The difference is that, in the post-work order, the system could in principle function without them. Their continued inclusion reflects not a need for their labor, but the motives and calculations of those who maintain the arrangement.


## 8. Elite Dependence on the Population

If most people are no longer needed as workers, why would those who control the system bother maintaining them at all? In a world of abundant automation, it is technically possible to imagine a much smaller, tightly managed population living within fortified enclaves, surrounded by neglected or abandoned regions. Yet the prevailing trajectory points instead toward a different arrangement: large populations kept alive, connected, and symbolically included, even when they have become structurally redundant as producers.

Earlier we saw that populations continue to perform several system-level functions in a post-work order: they anchor legitimacy, support compliance, provide identity, and sustain a sense of continuity. From the vantage point of those who govern and own key infrastructures, these do not appear as abstract “functions” so much as concrete motives—reasons to keep large populations inside the circle of concern even when their labor has become structurally redundant. Several overlapping motives become visible.

**Legitimacy.** Political and economic elites still need a story in which the system exists “for the people.” Even authoritarian regimes invest in narratives of national development, protection, or civilizational mission, and democracies lean even more heavily on the claim that institutions serve the public. A population whose lives are at least minimally supported functions as living evidence that this promise is being kept.

**Stability and risk management.** Large groups of people who are abandoned outright do not simply disappear; they become sources of unrest, migration, and systemic disruption. Whether the concern is framed as security, “social cohesion,” or crisis prevention, pacification through inclusion—maintaining basic income, healthcare, and simulated work—is cheaper and safer than confronting uncontrolled breakdowns.

**Audience.** Power seeks not only to rule, but to be seen ruling. Political leaders, corporate executives, and cultural figures all rely on publics—citizens, consumers, followers—to witness their actions, respond to their messaging, and affirm their status. A world in which automated systems quietly perform all necessary functions without human spectators would deprive elites of the recognition that makes their position meaningful; the population is kept, in part, as the audience before whom power performs.

**Moral and paternal motives.** Many elites understand themselves, and wish to be understood, as responsible stewards. Philanthropy, corporate social responsibility, and the language of “caring for our employees” or “serving our users” help sustain a self-image as benefactors rather than predators. Maintaining populations in a condition of managed inclusion allows those at the top to see themselves—and be seen—as doing good, or at least as doing what is necessary and humane.

**Status, respect, and narrative continuity.** Being deferred to, admired, and symbolically elevated depends on the existence of others who look up, respond, and remember. Elites may not need everyone to work, but they benefit from having many people whose lives, aspirations, and stories are organized around the institutions and brands they control. A shrinking or collapsing public weakens not only legitimacy, but the sense of historical importance and lasting impact that many at the top seek.

These motives—legitimacy, stability, audience, moral self-understanding, status, and continuity—converge on the same structural need. Even in a world where production can run with far fewer workers, those in power have strong incentives to maintain a large, managed population that continues to consume, participate, and bear witness. From their perspective, the population becomes less a workforce and more an audience whose ongoing presence is necessary to the story, even as it becomes increasingly peripheral to the functioning of the system itself.



## 9. The Circular Economy of Legitimacy

Here the **post-work paradox** takes its most compact form: a closed loop in which production no longer needs most people’s labor, yet the system must still route value back to a large population so that their consumption and participation can be presented as proof that it exists for their benefit.

Policy debates around automation already circle this problem. Proposals for universal basic income, wage subsidies, or job guarantees focus on how to connect people to the outputs of an increasingly automated system.[7][8][9] The emphasis falls less on preserving labor as such and more on preserving purchasing power and social inclusion once labor is no longer structurally necessary.

What emerges is not only an economic circuit but a **symbolic loop**. Income flows from automated systems to households through wages, transfers, or stipends; goods and services flow back out to those households; and metrics of participation—spending, engagement, observable activity—flow back to institutions as evidence that the system is working. The same flows that keep people materially afloat also sustain the narrative that the system exists *for* the population, even when it no longer depends on them in a material sense.

> The system pays people so they can consume the outputs that justify continued production, and their ongoing participation is cited as evidence that the system serves them.

This is the **post-work paradox**: production can run largely without human workers, yet legitimacy still depends on treating people as if they were central contributors. The system does not need most people’s labor to function, but it needs their **continued presence as recognized subjects** in order to justify its power.

In the industrial order, the legitimizing story had a clear material anchor. Workers could plausibly believe that their effort was indispensable to production and that their wages were a fair share of what they helped create. In a mature post-work order, that anchor erodes. The system no longer needs people to work so that production can continue, but it does need people to *appear* needed so that the arrangement can be experienced as fair, meaningful, or at least acceptable.

The result is a **circular economy of legitimacy**. Income and participation are distributed not only to manage demand, but to stabilize belief. Programs that promise inclusion and opportunity reinterpret structural redundancy as personal challenge, misfortune, or temporary dislocation. People are kept at the center of the story symbolically even as they are moved to the margins of its material functioning.

From the individual perspective, this can feel like a permanent probationary state: one is always trying to prove one’s relevance in a system that does not, in fact, rely on one’s contribution. There is no clear path back to being “needed” in the older sense of the term. One’s presence is required, but mainly as a consumer, a data source, and a bearer of legitimacy—someone whose continued participation helps stabilize an order that no longer needs one’s labor, only one’s presence.


## 10. Open Questions: Agency After Necessity

In this circular economy of legitimacy, the **post-work paradox** defines the background conditions for political and personal life. Populations are materially supported and symbolically included so that an order can be stabilized that no longer depends on their labor, while their consumption and participation are presented as evidence that the order exists for their benefit. Against that backdrop, questions of agency take on a different shape.

One set of questions concerns **resistance**. What does it mean to resist an order that can, in principle, absorb the withdrawal of most human labor without collapsing? Traditional labor struggles assumed that workers could threaten production by withholding work. In a mature post-work order, the leverage may lie elsewhere: in disrupting data flows, challenging the narratives that justify the arrangement, or forcing institutions to confront the costs of maintaining large populations in a condition of managed redundancy. The question is not only how to block production, but how to contest the terms on which populations are kept symbolically included and relatively stable.

A second set of questions concerns **collective agency**. If the main loop is one in which value circulates from automated systems to households and back again, what forms of coordination could redirect or repurpose that loop? Some imagine democratic control over automated infrastructures, with dividends from machine production funding shared services, cooperatives, or commons-oriented projects rather than primarily reinforcing existing hierarchies.[7][8][9] Others point to the possibility of new institutions—local, transnational, or digital—that treat automation as a commons to be governed rather than a private asset to be owned. Whether such arrangements can be built within the current order, or whether they require breaking or replacing the loop altogether, remains an open question.

A third set of questions concerns **meaning and subjectivity**. How do people make sense of their lives when they know, at some level, that the system no longer needs their work, but continues to insist on their participation? Simulated work, symbolic inclusion, and ritualized forms of voting or consultation can preserve the feeling of agency even when outcomes are highly constrained.[10] Over time, this can produce a split between the stories people tell themselves about contribution, citizenship, or calling, and the structural reality in which their redundancy is permanent but cannot be openly acknowledged. Whether new forms of meaning can emerge that are honest about this condition without collapsing into cynicism is an open problem.

These questions are not resolved by policy design alone. Designing transfers, benefits, or participation schemes can manage the immediate pressures of a post-work order, but it does not settle the deeper issue of what it would mean for populations to exercise genuine agency when they are no longer materially necessary to production. The circular economy of legitimacy stabilizes a particular answer: people remain at the center of the story as consumers, voters, and beneficiaries, while real control over automated infrastructures and long-term trajectories remains concentrated elsewhere. The unresolved question is whether alternative arrangements can be constructed that break or reroute this loop. Agency would no longer depend on being needed by the existing system, but on the capacity to shape what is built, for whom, and on what terms.
