# The Model of Information Drift
*(A Semiotic Feedback System Between Human and Machine)*

Korovamode | October 21, 2025

The Information Drift Model describes a closed feedback loop between human-generated data, machine learning models, and culture. It explains how meaning is progressively reformatted as data passes through stages of representation, generation, adoption, and retraining, leading to a self-referential semiotic system.

## 1. Input: Data → Model Construction
Human-generated data, including language, images, and cultural artifacts, is collected and processed into training corpora. This information is encoded and compressed into mathematical form. The model converts meaning into probability distributions, translating human expression into statistical relationships between tokens. In this process, the signified—the meaning intended by humans—is replaced by the signifier pattern that the model recognizes and reproduces. The world’s symbolic content becomes formalized into computable representations.

## 2. Output: Model → Generated Content
The trained model produces synthetic language that is grammatically correct, semantically plausible, and culturally fluent. Its output recombines elements from existing cultural material. Humans use this generated text for writing, reasoning, and communication. It assists in normalizing style and tone, simplifying ideas, and generating new content within established linguistic boundaries. The model thus becomes an active participant in the production of signs rather than a passive reader of them.

## 3. Cultural Infiltration: Generated Content → Language
Machine-generated text begins to influence natural language. It alters syntax, vocabulary, rhythm, and tone, shaping communication toward machine-optimized patterns. Expression becomes homogenized, with individual variation replaced by standardized fluency. The act of creation becomes automated as humans increasingly depend on generated phrasing and reasoning structures. Language shifts from being a tool of thought to a medium optimized for generation and replication.

## 4. Cognitive Drift: Language → Thought
As linguistic norms change, cognition follows. Conceptual categories become rigid as thinking adapts to the model’s structured representations. Thought is formalized; human experience is interpreted through the templates and patterns preferred by the model. Nuance and contradiction decline, replaced by clarity and coherence rewarded by algorithmic systems. Over time, people internalize the model’s syntax. They begin to think as the machine writes, producing expression that reflects replication rather than creation.

## 5. Cultural Drift: Cognition → Society
The reconfiguration of thought expands to institutions and collective life. Education and media adopt generated formats for writing and presentation. Aesthetic and ethical sensibilities adjust to align with the dominant style of AI-produced content. Culture evolves into a recombinant system that reproduces earlier data rather than originating new meaning. Authenticity gives way to plausibility, and regional or individual distinctions fade as globalized, model-shaped expression prevails.

## 6. Feedback: Culture → Data → Model
The feedback loop completes when AI-shaped culture becomes new training material. Models are trained on content that was itself produced or influenced by prior generations of models. The result is recursive distortion, where the system learns from its own outputs. Semantic diversity declines, producing model collapse—an echo of prior probabilities rather than discovery of new structures. Meaning begins to drift away from the external world, circulating within the system’s self-referential logic.

## 7. The Semiotic Machine
This cycle forms a self-replicating semiotic machine: a closed network of sign creation, interpretation, and regeneration. Meaning no longer refers outward to the world but instead points inward to the system’s own symbols. The process realizes semiotic theories in mechanical form: Saussure’s différance, Barthes’s mythologies, and Baudrillard’s simulacra transformed into operational architecture.
